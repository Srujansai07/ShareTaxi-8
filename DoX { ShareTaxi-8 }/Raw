I was just trying to explain, and you can understand, you can ask questions. So, I want to build some application, where, if there is a people in this IIT or in the entire society, they are going somewhere for a car, right, and I also wanted to go in the same place. So, I'll go to a, I'll just check it, who is going for this route, or who is going for Ramdhawa, today, in what time, and I see this is the, this guy is going for Ramdhawa, from this area, or this is the next society, it's far, just away from me, around 500 meters. So, in the AI, by using AI in auto, it can show this person is going this way, by seeing... You know, like, three more things. Yeah, so, this person going in this way, by using car, right? So, but this person who is going for this way, by using car, they also need to update on the AI, right? Because otherwise, how it will going to know, right? Like, so, so then, not update this, just how Ola Uber guy is doing. He doesn't need to do anything. So, that's why I'm able to know this person is going to Ramdhawa, and I also wanted to go Ramdhawa, let's catch up to this guy, and we both together can go Ramdhawa. Right? So, like, we can build some other app, like Ola and Uber in such way. Ola and Uber in such way, but this will be a sharing. Ola and Uber working in the, I can say, in a... Single person. In a single person, or in a commercial mode. They are a driver, right? This is not a driver. This is a Ola... This is a sharing thing. Yeah, so this person, both person having a good, their own job, corporate job. They are helping each other to go in the same place. And the backend, they can do whatever. We don't know. I mean, they can share money to someone. If I'm going with this guy, he's going for Ramdhawa. And we meet by using this app. But they can, I can pay him some amount of money as a fare, right? So, this is... Like a sharing, sharing. Yeah, for a sharing. So, this is for one, I can say, this is one for colliding. Let me give you a second example. If I wanted to go Bengaluru, don't forget about me. You know Rajkot? Rajkot, right? So, Rajkot is very far away from here. So, I wanted to go Rajkot. I'm somewhere in between rural area of Ramdhawa. So, I just open an app. I just see who are the people going for Rajkot. I connect these people via this app, in a sharing app. We sit in the same taxi and go for Rajkot. So, this app won't ask anything money. Just for taxi purpose. Just for taxi purpose, right? Because this is not... We cannot commercialize this by law. I hope you understand what I'm saying. Yes, sir. Only it's main about sharing. It's about sharing and use some AI. So, it shows these are the person in my surrounding. They are going for this place by using car. Come again.


So, let me start from the beginning. Let's say we are both going. You have a car. You have to go to Gip City. I also have to go to Gip City. I don't have a car. Now I have opened my app. I think you live in Palaj. You will leave from here. And you will see who is going to Gip City from Palaj, from this area, from 5 km. Your app's name will come first. Now it has come in my app. As the user said, 50 kgs of CO2 you are saving. And how much money are you saving? So, I want that the CO2 that is being saved, it should have a light number. For example, I am using it today and tomorrow. So, a month's calculation should be made that I have saved so much CO2 in this month. And the second thing. This is done. The second thing is that I have not saved that CO2 alone. You also have a co-operation in this. Because you gave me a lift. If you had not given a lift, I would have had to save that CO2 anyway. So, I said, that CO2 should go to your account. Because you are the main person who is saving CO2, right? So, it should be split between both. Did you understand? Because both parties are saving. And there should be a billing process. That we have saved so much CO2 in life. After saving the same CO2, we can also give a social rating to them. That this person has done a lot of social work. He has helped to release so much CO2. So, people will automatically get motivated and join. Did you understand?

🚗 App Idea — Ultra-Clear Brief

The app connects people who live in the same building or locality and are traveling to similar destinations, so they can go together in the same car or meet up for the ride.

Problem

In big cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Andhra, Many people from the same apartment/building Travel to the same areas But they go separately in different vehicles.

This causes:
Wasted fuel
Extra money spent
More traffic
No opportunity to socialize with neighbors

---

Solution (Your App)

A simple mobile app where:

1️⃣ Users show their live location Only within the building/locality — not public.

2️⃣ They set their destination
Example: “Going to Koramangala”, “Going to office”, “Going to city”, “Going to dinner”, etc.

3️⃣ They set their timing
Immediate, or scheduled (ex: leaving in 20 min).

4️⃣ The app automatically matches people
If two or more people from the same building are going to the same destination around the same time, the app shows:

“You can go together”
“You can take the same car”
“You can share Uber/auto"
Or “You can just go and eat together”

---

What the App Achieves

✔ Saves money
✔ Reduces traffic
✔ Builds community
✔ Very useful for apartments, hostels, working professionals
✔ Hyper-local mobility + social app

---

MVP Features (Minimum First Version)

Only the essentials:
Signup + verify building or locality
Set availability: “Going now / later”
Set destination
Real-time matching (who else is going)
Chat or contact option
Basic map / location sharing

---

Why Government Might Be Interested

Because it:
Reduces traffic
Reduces pollution
Encourages carpooling
Fits urban mobility improvement goals

So showing an MVP can help get grants or startup funding.

⭐ One-Line Summary

“A hyper-local carpool + meetup app that connects people from the same building going to the same destination at the same time.”


I was just trying to explain, and you can understand, you can ask questions. So, I want to build some application, where, if there is a people in this IIT or in the entire society, they are going somewhere for a car, right, and I also wanted to go in the same place.

So, I'll go to a, I'll just check it, who is going for this route, or who is going for Ramdhawa, today, in what time, and I see this is the, this guy is going for Ramdhawa, from this area, or this is the next society, it's far, just away from me, around 500 meters.

So, in the AI, by using AI in auto, it can show this person is going this way, by seeing... You know, like, three more things. Yeah, so, this person going in this way, by using car, right?

So, but this person who is going for this way, by using car, they also need to update on the AI, right? Because otherwise, how it will going to know, right? Like, so, so then, not update this, just how Ola Uber guy is doing. He doesn't need to do anything.

So, that's why I'm able to know this person is going to Ramdhawa, and I also wanted to go Ramdhawa, let's catch up to this guy, and we both together can go Ramdhawa. Right?

So, like, we can build some other app, like Ola and Uber in such way. Ola and Uber in such way, but this will be a sharing. Ola and Uber working in the, I can say, in a... Single person. In a single person, or in a commercial mode. They are a driver, right?

This is not a driver. This is a Ola... This is a sharing thing. Yeah, so this person, both person having a good, their own job, corporate job. They are helping each other to go in the same place.

And the backend, they can do whatever. We don't know. I mean, they can share money to someone. If I'm going with this guy, he's going for Ramdhawa. And we meet by using this app. But they can, I can pay him some amount of money as a fare, right?

So, this is... Like a sharing, sharing. Yeah, for a sharing. So, this is for one, I can say, this is one for colliding.

Let me give you a second example. If I wanted to go Bengaluru, don't forget about me. You know Rajkot? Rajkot, right? So, Rajkot is very far away from here. So, I wanted to go Rajkot. I'm somewhere in between rural area of Ramdhawa.

So, I just open an app. I just see who are the people going for Rajkot. I connect these people via this app, in a sharing app. We sit in the same taxi and go for Rajkot.

So, this app won't ask anything money. Just for taxi purpose. Just for taxi purpose, right? Because this is not... We cannot commercialize this by law. I hope you understand what I'm saying.

Yes, sir. Only it's main about sharing. It's about sharing and use some AI. So, it shows these are the person in my surrounding. They are going for this place by using car. Come again.

So, let me start from the beginning. Let's say we are both going. You have a car. You have to go to Gip City. I also have to go to Gip City. I don't have a car.

Now I have opened my app. I think you live in Palaj. You will leave from here. And you will see who is going to Gip City from Palaj, from this area, from 5 km.

Your app's name will come first. Now it has come in my app. As the user said, 50 kgs of CO2 you are saving. And how much money are you saving?

So, I want that the CO2 that is being saved, it should have a light number. For example, I am using it today and tomorrow. So, a month's calculation should be made that I have saved so much CO2 in this month.

And the second thing. This is done. The second thing is that I have not saved that CO2 alone. You also have a co-operation in this. Because you gave me a lift. If you had not given a lift, I would have had to save that CO2 anyway.

So, I said, that CO2 should go to your account. Because you are the main person who is saving CO2, right? So, it should be split between both. Did you understand? Because both parties are saving.

And there should be a billing process. That we have saved so much CO2 in life. After saving the same CO2, we can also give a social rating to them. That this person has done a lot of social work. He has helped to release so much CO2.

So, people will automatically get motivated and join. Did you understand?
